Made for Ludum Dare #25
"You Are the Villain"

---

A game inspired by the game the villain plays from 0:40 to 0:42 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFauNH7-U4g). Playable online [here](https://nicknicknicknick.itch.io/greedy-aardvark).

A nutritious part of 73% of all Canadians' childhoods, The Raccoons were idiots.
Their overlord was Cyril Sneer, but his tyranny was generally undone by his jerk son et al.

_Greedy Aardvark_ puts us in the aardshoes of this Machiavellian despot, 
that we may one day play the same games, digital and psychological, as he.

Regarding the controls (arrows to move, thassit): they're a bit funky, but again,
I'm basing them off the movement in the video. Which is seeming increasingly arbitrary.

Just use the arrow keys for everything. R to restart from Level 1.

I didn't have time to actually make models for things, so Cyril Sneer is a block.

Evergreen trees are blocks.

Bags of money are blocks. You'll figure it out.

Cyril moves in a really bizarre way, but again: refer back to the footage.
Email Kevin Gillis, creator of "The Raccoons," for more information.

There are exactly TEN levels.

I apologise for the tenth (it is potentially unwinnable).

Note: you'll need to provide your own copy of Kevin Gillis' "Run With Us" at `Assets/sounds/RunWithUs.ogg` (referred to in the `_globalObject` in `scnGameOver`).
